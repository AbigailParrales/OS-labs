This project has the objective of:
Every time a new client connects, server will provide the current time
When a new client is connected, the server prints the client id and then sends the time
Multiple clients can connect to a single server
Server time information can be obtained from time.h
Add command line support for the client ID. Example: "./client3 <id>"
Client should send ID to the server
Once a client is started, it will keep sending time request to the server every second.
Test multiple client3 at the same time.
