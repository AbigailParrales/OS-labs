LAB1.7

In this lab I created an interactive program that allows you to view the simmulation of four scheduling algorithms:
	1.-First-Come, First Served (FCFS)
	2.-Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
	3.-Priority Scheduling
	4.-Round-Robin Scheduling

How to run this program?
	Files needed
		main.c
		heap.h
	Compile the program 
		gcc main.c -o main
	Run the program
		./main
